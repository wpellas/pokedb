# What is Poke DB?

A React App using https://pokeapi.co/ to fetch and list every single available Pokémon.

## How does it work?

It fetches the long list of Pokémon and loops through each name to once again fetch each respective Pokémons individual attribute page, where certain props are passed onto their respective cards.

### Can I use it?
